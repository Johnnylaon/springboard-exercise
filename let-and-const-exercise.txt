- What is hoisting?
It’s the way that we explain how the JS compiler works. Variables are lifting or “hoisted” to the top of the scope they are declared in. When using ***var***, you can access the variable name and it’s undefined value before it is used later on.

Function declarations are also hoisted and can be invoked “before” they are defined in a codebase.
